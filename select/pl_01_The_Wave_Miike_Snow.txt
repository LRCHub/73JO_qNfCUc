The first strike of the hammer
Make my heart beats faster
The rat tattoo on my knee
That there was something
behind me
You can hear them
You can hear them
banging on the tin
But my love won't be sane
Will I be staring at the wave
Staring at the wave
Staring at the wave
They told me I wasn't anything
Before the bombs started falling
I was a feat for the master
I was a walking disaster
I know you hear me coming
I know you hear the sound
I know you feel me coming
Don't let me get you down
You can hear them
You can hear them
banging on the tin
But my love won't be sane
Will I be staring at the wave
But my love won't be sane
Will I be staring at the wave
<♪>
Staring at the wave
