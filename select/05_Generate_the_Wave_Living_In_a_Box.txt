Everyday gets harder and harder
Do we know what we're fighting for
Does it matter who wins the battle
When we're all losing the war

We got the power
I can feel it coming
We got the power
Build it up, I gotta build it up

Can you feel it coming on

A braver world
A greater decision
Stronger men with a single mind
Never change I'm changing my vision
But I know we're gonna find

We got the power
I can feel it coming
We got the power
Build it up, I gotta build it up

Over land, over sea
They take in hand their destiny
Standing up for what is right (We generate)
To make a point put up a fight, put up a fight

Can't you feel it
Can't you feel it
Can't you feel the rush
Can't you feel it
Can't you feel it
Can't you feel the rush

Another time, another place
The golden line comes face to face, comes face to face
Keep your head, I don't lose touch (We generate)
This time is up
Now feel the rush, now feel the rush

We got the power
I can feel it coming
We got the power
Build it up, I gotta build it up
