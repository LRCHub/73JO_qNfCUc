I'm not a man
And I'm lying here again
I'm not a man... I am
Did I offend you when
I was almost in
Try me again, I'll lock the door
I can't ignore your voice
If you dance, if you dine
You can fake, I can lie
If we dance, if we dine
If you wave, wave goodbye
Undress with my eyes
I can show you my disguiseIs this who I am?... I am
It's all in a glance
I can love you with my hand
I'm not a man
If you dance if you dine
You can fake, I can lie
If we dance, if we die
If you wave, wave goodbye
All I ever want from you
Is to know that I can be blameless
But all that I can do inside is throw my life away
But I've already come
