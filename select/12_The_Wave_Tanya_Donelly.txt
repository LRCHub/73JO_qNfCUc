(T. Donelly / D. Fisher)

My face has never been one to betray me
It shines when I need it to
It sends out a white blinding light in your eyes
'Till I figure out what I'm gonna do

We meet in the kitchen and roll on the floor
And I look in your face for something restoring
And take from you barely enough for a lifetime of
Holding out on you
Holding out on you

I see my storyline within you
And I see the river rise to meet you
'Cause you started you started
Harnessing the wave
And you started you started
Harnessing the wave

My face has never been one to betray me
It lies when I need it to
But lately it seems you been laughing at me
So I guess you're the one I can't fool

I see my storyline within you
And I see the river rise to meet you
And I see my angel kneel to kiss you
Cause you started you started
Harnessing the wave
And you started you started
Harnessing the wave

You started
You started honey
